### Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed in the `<head>`.

The main advantage of placing it in the `<head>` is that you will track the
user's `pageview` even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded.
However, having the code at the bottom of the page [helps improve
performance](https://stevesouders.com/efws/inline-scripts-bottom.php).


### How can I integrate [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with HTML5 Boilerplate?

One simple way is to use [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) and create a
custom build that includes both HTML5 Boilerplate and
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

Read more about how [HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap complement each
other](https://www.quora.com/Is-Bootstrap-a-complement-or-an-alternative-to-HTML5-Boilerplate-or-viceversa/answer/Nicolas-Gallagher).


### Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released?

No, same as you don't normally replace the foundation of a house once it
was built. However, there is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the
latest changes, but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.


### Where can I get help with support questions?

Please ask for help on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5boilerplate).
