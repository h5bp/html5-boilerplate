## Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released?

No, just as you don't normally replace the foundation of a house once it was
built. However, there is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the latest
changes, but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.

## Where can I get help with support questions?

Please ask for help on
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5boilerplate).
